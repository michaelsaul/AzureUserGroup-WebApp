Session 1: Exploring Azure App Service (April 28th)

In this session, we will take a look at the Azure App Service and how it can help you deploy Web, Mobile, API and Logic Apps. We will demonstrate deploying a lightweight web application, and integration with a GitHub repository. Finally, we will enable A/B Testing with the use of deployment slots.

Session 2: Extending Azure App Services (May 17th)

Building on what we learned from the previous session, we will explore the App Service Console and how we can extend the functionality of Azure App Service to support additional languages. We will demonstrate deployment of Ruby framework to the Azure App Service using Azure App Service Extensions or Kudu.

Session 3: Global Distributed App Environments (June 21th)

In our final session, we will explore the benefits of Azure App Service Environments and their ability to provide scalable, secure, and isolated environments. We will then demonstrate a geographically distributed application using Azure Traffic Manager for load balancing and failover.
